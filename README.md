## 💡 Project Overview

The **IoT-Based Automated Exam Hall and Seat Allotment System** is an innovative solution designed to **digitize and automate the traditional exam seating process** using IoT technology and web integration.

The system efficiently manages student identification, exam hall allocation, and seat assignment in real-time using **RFID technology** and **Raspberry Pi** microcontrollers. It eliminates manual errors, saves time, and provides faculty with instantly downloadable reports of student distribution across rooms.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### 🧠 Software
- **Python Flask** — Backend web framework  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — Frontend web interface  
- **MySQL** — Database management and storage  

### 🔌 Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi 2 Model B** — Central IoT controller  
- **13.56 MHz RFID Scanner** — Student identification device

## 🧩 System Workflow

1. Each student is assigned a unique RFID ID card linked to their profile in the **MySQL database**.  
2. When the student scans the RFID card on the **scanner connected to Raspberry Pi**, the system verifies their identity.  
3. The backend (Python Flask) dynamically **allocates an exam room and seat** based on availability and predefined rules.  
4. The allocation details are updated in the database and displayed on the web interface for faculty monitoring.  
5. Faculty members can **download reports** of student seating arrangements for each exam hall.
